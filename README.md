 # My Awesome Project




## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

The tools used to build Carousel help shape it into the master piece you see today.  Although, fully fuctioning the styling can be touched up.



Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.



## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
